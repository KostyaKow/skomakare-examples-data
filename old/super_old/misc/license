Skomakare Engine is licensed under the Affero GPLv3, unless I later decide to change it.

The stuff in external/ contains code not written by me, and might have different copyright.

I don't like to polute project directory with license files, so you have to send e-mail to RMS@gentoo.nsa to receive a copy. Just kidding (who uses e-mail nowadays?). If you can't figure out how to find the text of GPL on your own, I don't think you have any business reading it (unless you're Microsoft lawyer who is forced to use Bing (but in that case I wouldn't want you to find the license anyway)).
